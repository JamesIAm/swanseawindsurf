					In 2019 the SUWC returned to Sardinia after such a fantastic
					year previously. The wind was fantastic, with some days
					suitable for beginners and some more suited to the advanced
					sailors and the crazier beginners. <br />
					After challenging a rental car's suspension with the sheer
					weight of beer in the boot, we had tons of fun knocking back
					Best Br√§us and wine on the beach. Towards the end of the
					holiday, the infamous beach olympics made a return, with all
					sort of non-regulation sports, like wheel barrow races, and
					lots of spinning, which ended with Max Max playing some
					impromptu hide and seek with the rest of the club.
					<br /> On the few days that there was little wind, we rented
					kayaks and stand up paddleboards, and paddled out to various
					beaches to work on our tan (spelt b-u-r-n).

					The annual SUWC holiday took it's trip to the italian island
					of Sardinia in 2018. We stayed in Blue Corner residences in
					Porto Pollo, and rented equipment from the nearby
					MBProcentre. With good wind, 24/7 banter and England still
					dreaming about it coming home, it was another week to be
					remembered. Here are a few snaps from the trip.
