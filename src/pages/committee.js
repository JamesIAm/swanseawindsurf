								Dark horse of the year 2018/19, Max thrilled us all with his
								antics on our last trip to Sardinia, with an innocent nap in a
								neighbouring field resulting in some very concerned windsurfers.
								He was part of our BUCS winning team in 2019 though, so more
								than made up for it. Max is also a intermediate windsurf
								instructor who has been windsurfing since he was 14.

								Hi everyone, Iâ€™m Kathryn and Iâ€™m incredibly excited to start my
								fifth year as a member of Swansea Windsurfing Club! Having being
								a member of the club for so many years youâ€™d assume that I was a
								skilled windsurferâ€¦ however, this is not the case. I love
								spending time on the water, but I am definitely a more seasoned
								party goer rather than sailor. This year I will be juggling my
								role of events manager with my clinical psychology masters. You
								can expect me to organise an incredible wave event, be forever
								nagging you all to purchase tickets for the other amazing SWA
								events and see me cutting shapes on the dance floor to some
								sweet 00â€™s tunes.ðŸ’ƒðŸ’«
